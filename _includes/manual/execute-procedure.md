## Execute Procedure

`Execute procedure` executes a stored procedure or function for each row of data table, binding input/output parameters to columns of the data table, eg:

    !|Execute Procedure|MyStoredProcedure|
    |param1|param2|sum?                  |
    |2     |2     |4                     |
    |5     |6     |11                    |

### Syntax

1. **First row** *(mandatory)*

    * first cell *(mandatory)*: Execute Procedure
    * second cell *(mandatory)*: the procedure or function name

2. **Second row** *(applicable only if the procedure has parameters)*

     * each cell specifies a parameter name
     * output parameters are defined by adding a question mark to the end of the name
     * parameter order or case is not important
     * you can even insert blanks and split names into several words to make the test page more readable. Blanks are removed by DbFit to get the parameter name (eg `second string` => `secondstring`):

            !|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateStrings   |
            |first string|second string|concatenated?|
            |Hello       |World        |Hello World  |
            |Ford        |Prefect      |Ford Prefect |

    * to use IN/OUT parameters, you'll need to specify the parameter twice. Once without the question mark, when it is used as the input; and one with the question mark when it is used as output:

            |Execute Procedure|Multiply|
            |factor|val|val?           |
            |5     |10 |50             |

3. **Subsequent rows** *(applicable only if the procedure has parameters)*

    * you can store any output value into a parameter with the `>>` syntax or send current parameter values to procedure using `<<` syntax:

            !|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateStrings   |
            |first string|second string|concatenated?|
            |Hello       |World        |>>result     |
            
            !|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateStrings       |
            |first string|second string|concatenated?    |
            |<<result    |Again        |Hello World Again|

### Calling procedures without parameters

For the case where neither parameters nor return values are specified, `Execute Procedure` should be called with just one row (without a row for column header names).

    !|Execute Procedure|MakeUser|

### Calling functions

If a function is getting called, then a column containing just the question mark is used for function results.

    !3 Stored functions are treated like procs - just put ? in the result column header

    !|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF        |
    |first string|second string|?           |
    |Hello       |World        |Hello World |
    |Ford        |Prefect      |Ford Prefect|

    !3 ? does not have to appear on the end (although it is a good practice to put it there)

    !|Execute Procedure|ConcatenateF        |
    |second string|?           |first string|
    |World        |Hello World |Hello       |
    |Prefect      |Ford Prefect|Ford        |

### Influence on test results

* If the procedure has no output parameters, then the `Execute Procedure` command has no effect on the [result of the test](/dbfit/docs/test-framework.html#test-results-and-cell-outcomes) - unless an error occurs during processing.
* If the procedure has output parameters, then those cells are compared to the expectation cells specified in the test table, and are used to determine whether the test has passed or failed.

### Expecting exceptions

Normally, the test would fail if a database exception occurs. If you want to test a boundary condition that should cause an exception, then use `Execute Procedure Expect Exception` variant of the `Execute Procedure` command, eg:

    !|Execute Procedure Expect Exception|createuser|
    |new name   |new username                      |
    |arthur dent|adent                             |

You can even specify an optional exception code as the third argument. If no exception code is specified, then the test will pass if any error occurs for each data row. If the third argument is specified, then the actual error code is also taken into consideration for failing the test.

    !|Execute Procedure Expect Exception|createuser|1062|
    |new name   |new username                           |
    |arthur dent|adent                                  |

#### Standalone mode

 `Execute Procedure Expect Exception` variant is not directly available as a separate table in standalone mode. If you need this functionality in standalone mode, then extend the `ExecuteProcedure` fixture and call the appropriate constructor. That class has several constructors for exceptions and error codes.

#### Exceptions with SQL Server

For detailed exception code verifications to work with SQL Server, user message must be registered for that particular error code, or SQL Server throws a generic error code outside the database. Here is how you can declare your error code:

    sp_addmessage @msgnum = 53120, @severity=1, @msgtext = 'test user defined error msg'
